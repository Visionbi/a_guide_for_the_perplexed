# Unit Testing

## ‚ÄúIt Is‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt Is Not‚Äù :
First , just to make sure there is no confusion around this term - unit testing means that a developer is writing a piece of code to test 
a small component or a unit of his software (_independently from other parts_). Because the scope is very limited , there is no way to test it without writing code.
**It is not** a manual testing the developer is doing before handing over the code to QA for further testing.



## what do you need to know :
There are many frameworks you can use to write unit tests :
*	in java you can use JUnit
*	in python you can use PyUnit, unittest, pytest
*	additional javaScript test frameworks : Jasmine, Mocha and QUnit 

Just choose one and start coding ‚Ä¶


## why ‚Äì I am not convinced yet :
- When something goes wrong, you can just rerun your unit tests and find the source of the bug instead of looking through all of the software.
-	You are writing code that will make users happy (or customers üòä) , hopefully, you will add new functionality and upgrades . The unit tests can be helpful to
ensure you didn‚Äôt break anything.
-	This is the ultimate way for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

 ‚Äú
Best way to convince... find a bug, write a unit test for it, fix the bug.
That particular bug is unlikely to ever appear again, and you can prove it with your test.
If you do this enough, others will catch on quickly.‚Äù


## 100% Code coverage  - really ?
Well, there are certain tools to measure code coverage i.e what percentage of the code written for the product is tested by a unit test. Many software development managers believe that 100% code coverage is necessary to ensure that the code is tested adequately. 
Writing many unit tests on every piece of code, will take time and money . A developer can only write ~N lines of code a week and you need to figure out what percentage of that code should be unit test code vs production code so here are a few principles for better unit testing :

- Isolation - avoid dependencies on environment settings or databases. A single test should not depend on running other tests before it, nor should it be affected by the order of execution of other tests.
- A test should either always pass or fail until fixed. Having a unit test that passes some of the time is equivalent to not having a test at all.
- If it failed , do not forget to write why (expected vs. actual). This will definitely serve the developer in the best way possible.
- Naming convention - the test method name is very important. When a well-named test fails, it is easier to understand what was tested and why it failed.
- Unit testing should be easy, if it is too complicated you probably need to refactor the code
- For work balance and knowledge sharing, consider involving an additional team member to take part in this effort.
